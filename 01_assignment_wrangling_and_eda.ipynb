        "1. Numeric variable: For `airbnb_NYC.csv`, clean the `Price` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. How many missing values do you end up with? (Hint: What happens to the formatting when a price goes over 999 dollars, say from 675 to 1,112?)\n",
        "2. Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing? For the remaining missing values, replace the `np.nan/None` values with the label `Missing`.\n",
        "3. Dummy variable: For `metabric.csv`, convert the `Overall Survival Status` variable into a dummy/binary variable, taking the value 0 if the patient is deceased and 1 if they are living.\n",
        "4. Missing values: For `airbnb_NYC.csv`, determine how many missing values of `Review Scores Rating` there are. Create a new variable, in which you impute the median score for non-missing observations to the missing ones. Why might this bias or otherwise negatively impact your results?"
